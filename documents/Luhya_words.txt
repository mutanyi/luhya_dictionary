Luwanga-English Dictionary

draft of 03/02/2008
Foreward
The present draft is based on Appleby’s 1943 Luhya-English Vocabulary, an electronic version
of which was prepared by Michael Marlo with assistance from University of Michigan
undergraduate students Sarah Crane, Namira Islam, and Callie Masten. This wordlist was retranslated into the Luwanga dialect of Luluyia by Alfred Anangwe in summer 2006. At this time,
each of the Luwanga lexical items was pronounced and recorded by Anangwe. In January 2008,
the wordlist was entered into electronic format by Anangwe and edited by Marlo. The present
draft is given in Luwanga orthography, which does not represent tonal or vowel length
distinctions (many cases of vowel sequences represent hiatus or a glide followed by long vowel;
most long vowels are not transcribed). We plan to add more accurate phonetic transcriptions as
soon as possible and welcome any comments, additions, and corrections. Please send any
remarks to both authors. Research support for this dictionary was provided a National Science
Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and NSF Doctoral Research Improvement Grant
0545246 to Michael Marlo.
